# Predicting-Movie-Success-Rate

* Movies have many attributes such as Genre, Language, Country of Production, IMDB ratings, Cast, Duration etc. The aim of this project was to analyse data 
of movies and find out if there are any particular attributes that have a significant impact on success of the movie. The success of the movie is calculated using the ratio of global revenue vs the movie budget. Feature importance of various attributes was calculated by fitting classification models.

* The entire project was done in R, leveraging various libraries in Tidyverse for data wrangling and ggplot2 for data visualization.
